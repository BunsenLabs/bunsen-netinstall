#!/bin/bash
# This is intended to be a general-purpose script to install
# a desktop environment, possibly BunsenLabs,
# on a Debian netinstall base. (See README for more details.)
# It will modify and add some system files, install the necessary
# packages and copy configuration files into your home directory.
# These changes might be reversible, but no guarantees are offered,
# and all the usual caveats apply.
# This install script is intended to be run on a newly installed
# system with no personal settings or data. Attempts will be made to
# backup any such data that might exist, but do not rely on it.

# USAGE
# This script should come in a folder called bunsen-?-netinstall,
# along with a collection of other necessary files.
# Change directory (cd) into that folder and run
# ./install
# to start the installation process.
# A folder called .bunsen-netinstall-logs will be added to your home folder.
# This may safely be removed if the installation was successful.
# A folder /backup (or other name) on your root file system will hold
# backups of system files replaced during the install.
