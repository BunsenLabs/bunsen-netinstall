This is a network installer for
BunsenLabs Linux on cli Debian Bookworm.

It will use the BunsenLabs Boron repository
to download and install necessary packages,
along with packages from the Debian repositories,
and do any other necessary configuration.

While there is a good chance of installing a working system,
please be ready to deal with any bugs that show up!
